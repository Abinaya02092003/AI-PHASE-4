## Introduction
Welcome to the AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System, Phase 4 README. This document serves as a guide for developers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals interested in utilizing and contributing to this diabetes prediction system.

## Project Overview
The AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related factors. It's built in a series of phases, with Phase 4 focusing on enhancing the model's accuracy and preparing it for deployment.

Phase 4 includes improved data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, making it more reliable for real-world applications. It also lays the foundation for deployment, so the system can be used in healthcare settings.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Enhanced data cleaning and feature engineering to improve data quality.
- Model training: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to build a more accurate diabetes prediction model.
- Model evaluation: Robust evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Deployment: Ready for deployment in healthcare environments.
- Extensible: The system can be extended with additional data sources and features for improved predictions.
